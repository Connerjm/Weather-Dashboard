## Introduction

This application is a browser based weather dashboard. Utilizing the OpenWeather API, the user will be able to search for a city and recieve the basic weather information and present it in the dynamic UI.

The acceptance criteria is as follows:

- [ ] Upon searching for a city, the user is presented with current and future weather conditions for that city.
- [ ] Searched cities are added to the search history.
- [ ] When viewing current weather for a given city, the city name, date, icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index are presented.
- [ ] Upon viewing the UV index, a color that indicates conditions is shown.
- [ ] When looking at future weather conditions for a given city, the user is presented with a five day forcast displaying date, icon, temperature and humidity.
- [ ] When clicking a city in the search history, the info for that city is presented again.

Some notes to self:

- What we need from the initial api call

  - main>temp
  - main>humidity
  - wind>speed
  - UV index???

- What we need from the 5day forecast call

  - dt_txt
  - main>temp
  - main>humidity

- Make sure to handle errors in the api calls. Use a modal for html.cat images?

- Resource links I need.
